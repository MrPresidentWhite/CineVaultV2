- **Language:** All code comments (JSDoc, inline) must be in English. New and revised comments: English only.
- Only comment important/complex logic
- Keep comments concise and meaningful
- Focus on "why" rather than "what" for complex business logic
- Avoid obvious comments that just repeat the code

## Code Quality
- Write clean, modern, maintainable code
- Follow React/Next.js best practices
- Separate server and client code clearly
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement secure API communication

## Architecture
- Modular system design
- Future-proof extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Server-side and client-side code separation
